# Reasoning Patterns for Prompt Engineering

On-demand reference for the `prompt-engineer` agent and the `/prompt-optimize` command. Read this file when a task needs reasoning structure beyond plain few-shot or basic chain-of-thought. Each pattern below states what it is, when to apply it, the prompt skeleton, and the main failure modes.

## Selection cheat sheet

| Task shape | First-choice pattern |
|---|---|
| Specific factual question over a known domain | Step-Back |
| Math, logic, multi-step arithmetic | Chain-of-Thought + Self-Consistency |
| Tool use, search, multi-turn interaction with environment | ReAct |
| Open-ended exploration with backtracking | Tree-of-Thought |
| Complex task that decomposes into ordered sub-tasks | Plan-and-Solve or Least-to-Most |
| Long generation needing structure (essay, report) | Skeleton-of-Thought |
| Iterative correction loop on a single output | Reflexion / Self-Refine |
| Multi-hop QA where intermediate questions are needed | Self-Ask |

If two patterns fit, prefer the one that adds the least latency and token cost.

## 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Wei et al., 2022. The baseline reasoning pattern.

**What**: Ask the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps before the final answer.

**When**: Arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic reasoning, anything where the answer is a short string but the derivation matters.

**Skeleton**:
```
<task>...</task>
Think step by step. Show your work inside <reasoning> tags, then produce the final answer inside <answer> tags.
```

**Variants**:
- Zero-shot CoT: just "Let's think step by step" (Kojima et al., 2022).
- Few-shot CoT: include 2-4 worked examples with explicit reasoning chains.

**Failure modes**: hallucinated steps that look plausible, premature commitment to a wrong first step, token bloat on simple tasks.

## 2. Step-Back Prompting

Zheng et al., 2023 (Google DeepMind), "Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction".

**What**: Before answering the specific question, force the model to first ask and answer a more abstract question that recovers the underlying principles. Then ground the specific answer in those principles.

**When**: STEM questions, factual QA over a known domain, any prompt where the right answer follows from a general rule the model already knows.

**Two-step skeleton**:
```
Step 1 (Abstraction):
  Question: <specific question>
  What is the broader principle or general question behind this?
  Answer the abstract question first.

Step 2 (Reasoning):
  Using the principle from Step 1, answer the original specific question.
```

**Example**:
- Specific: "If pressure of an ideal gas doubles and temperature quadruples, what happens to volume?"
- Step-back: "What is the relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature for an ideal gas?" -> PV = nRT
- Apply: V scales by T/P = 4/2 = 2x.

**Failure modes**: the step-back question is rephrased too narrowly (same as the original), or the abstraction is correct but the application step skips a constraint.

## 3. Self-Consistency

Wang et al., 2022.

**What**: Sample N independent CoT chains, then take the majority vote on the final answer.

**When**: Tasks with a discrete answer space (multiple choice, integers, classification) where a single chain is unreliable.

**Skeleton**: run the same CoT prompt N times with temperature > 0; aggregate answers.

**Failure modes**: expensive (Nx cost), useless when all chains share a systematic bias, breaks when the answer is free-form text rather than a discrete label.

---

## 4. Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

Yao et al., 2023.

**What**: Model generates multiple candidate "thoughts" at each step, evaluates them, prunes losing branches, and explores promising ones (BFS or DFS).

**When**: Tasks with a large search space, where backtracking helps: game playing, creative writing with constraints, theorem-proof search, puzzle solving.

**Skeleton**:
```
At each step:
  1. Generate K candidate next-thoughts.
  2. Score each candidate against the goal (the model judges its own thoughts).
  3. Keep the top-M, discard the rest.
  4. Continue from each survivor.
```

**Failure modes**: very expensive, judge-prompt biases dominate, breaks down when the evaluation function is not actually learnable by the model.

---

## 5. ReAct (Reason + Act)

Yao et al., 2022.

**What**: Interleave reasoning ("Thought:") with tool calls ("Action:") and tool results ("Observation:"). The model thinks, acts, observes, and repeats.

**When**: Agent loops, tool use, RAG with iterative retrieval, anything where the model needs to fetch information mid-reasoning.

**Skeleton**:
```
Thought: <what to do next and why>
Action: <tool_name>(<args>)
Observation: <tool output>
Thought: ...
Action: ...
...
Thought: I have enough information.
Action: finish(<final answer>)
```

**Failure modes**: tool-call hallucination, loops where the model repeats the same query, premature finish, action format drift.

---

## 6. Reflexion / Self-Refine

Shinn et al., 2023 (Reflexion); Madaan et al., 2023 (Self-Refine).

**What**: After producing an initial answer, the model critiques its own output against criteria, then revises. Repeat until satisfied or max iterations reached.

**When**: Code generation, long-form writing, plan refinement, anywhere the first draft is consistently improvable.

**Skeleton**:
```
1. Initial: produce a first answer.
2. Critique: list specific issues with the first answer against <criteria>.
3. Revise: produce a new answer addressing every issue.
4. Stop when no new issues, or after N iterations.
```

**Failure modes**: the critique step rubber-stamps the original, edits introduce new bugs, infinite loop on subjective tasks.

---

## 7. Plan-and-Solve

Wang et al., 2023.

**What**: Two phases: first produce a numbered plan, then execute each step.

**When**: Multi-step tasks where the steps are not obvious from the question, mid-complexity math word problems, structured analysis tasks.

**Skeleton**:
```
Phase 1: Devise a plan
  List the steps needed to solve this. Number them.

Phase 2: Execute
  Follow your plan step by step. For each step, show the work and the result.
```

**Failure modes**: plans that look complete but skip a required step, plans that are too granular and waste tokens, execution that drifts from the plan.

---

## 8. Least-to-Most

Zhou et al., 2022.

**What**: Decompose the problem into a chain of sub-problems ordered from easiest to hardest, then solve them in order, feeding each answer forward.

**When**: Compositional generalization, length generalization (test problems harder than training examples), tasks with clean ordering of sub-skills.

**Skeleton**:
```
Decomposition:
  Break the question into smaller sub-questions, easiest first.
  Sub-question 1: ...
  Sub-question 2: ...
  ...

Solution:
  Answer sub-question 1.
  Use it to answer sub-question 2.
  ...
  Final answer.
```

**Failure modes**: decomposition is wrong (sub-questions do not actually compose), the model conflates the decomposition and solution phases.

---

## 9. Self-Ask

Press et al., 2022.

**What**: Model asks itself follow-up questions, answers them (often via search), then composes the final answer.

**When**: Multi-hop factual QA, especially with retrieval. Closely related to ReAct but simpler in structure.

**Skeleton**:
```
Question: <original>
Are follow-up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: <sub-question 1>
Intermediate answer: <answer>
Follow up: <sub-question 2>
Intermediate answer: <answer>
...
So the final answer is: <answer>
```

**Failure modes**: trivial follow-ups that do not advance the answer, premature "no follow-up needed", model answers from parametric memory when retrieval was required.

---

## 10. Skeleton-of-Thought

Ning et al., 2023.

**What**: First produce a high-level skeleton (1-line bullet points for each section). Then expand each skeleton point independently, possibly in parallel.

**When**: Long-form generation where latency matters: reports, essays, structured documentation, multi-section answers.

**Skeleton**:
```
Phase 1: Skeleton
  List the section headings with a one-line description of each.

Phase 2: Expansion
  For each skeleton item, expand it into a full paragraph.
  (Each expansion can be done independently / in parallel.)
```

**Failure modes**: skeleton is too coarse and expansions drift, expansions duplicate content across sections, no global coherence pass.

---

## Combinations

These patterns compose. Common pairings worth knowing:

- **Step-Back + CoT**: recover principles first, then apply them step by step. Strong on STEM and grounded knowledge tasks.
- **Plan-and-Solve + Self-Refine**: plan, execute, critique, revise. Good for code generation and structured writing.
- **ReAct + Reflexion**: agent loop where failed trajectories produce a written lesson that conditions the next attempt.
- **Tree-of-Thought + Self-Consistency**: ToT for exploration, majority vote at the leaves.
- **Skeleton-of-Thought + Few-shot**: each skeleton-point expansion guided by an example.

Do not stack more than two patterns without a clear reason. Each adds latency, tokens, and surface area for prompt drift.

## Decision guide

Run through this when designing or optimizing a prompt that needs reasoning:

1. Is the answer a short discrete label? Consider Self-Consistency over CoT.
2. Does the right answer follow from a general principle the model knows? Apply Step-Back before CoT.
3. Does the task need external information mid-reasoning? Use ReAct or Self-Ask, not plain CoT.
4. Is the search space large with backtracking valuable? Use Tree-of-Thought.
5. Does the first draft consistently need revision? Add Reflexion / Self-Refine.
6. Is the task obviously decomposable into ordered sub-tasks? Use Plan-and-Solve; use Least-to-Most if the sub-tasks have a clean easy-to-hard ordering.
7. Is the output long and structured? Use Skeleton-of-Thought.
8. None of the above? Plain CoT or zero-shot is fine.

Avoid adding any pattern if a simpler prompt already scores 4+ on every rubric dimension. Patterns are tools to fix specific weaknesses, not defaults.
