## Quick Start Recipes

**Build a feature end-to-end:**
```
/agent-teams:team-feature "add user authentication"
```

**Review code before shipping:**
```
/code-review              # auto-detect scope
/full-review src/         # deep analysis + multi-agent review
```

**Optimize React performance:**
```
/review-react src/
```

**Map an unfamiliar codebase:**
```
/map-codebase ../other-project
```

**Track your usage and costs:**
```
/cc-usage 30d
```

See the [agent-teams plugin](plugins/agent-teams.md) for multi-agent pipeline commands with Mermaid diagrams.
