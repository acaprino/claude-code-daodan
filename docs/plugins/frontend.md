## Quick Reference

| Need | Tool | What it does |
|------|------|------|

| "Build it from scratch" | `/agent-teams:team-design` | Orchestrates frontend agents |
| "Improve what exists" | `/agent-teams:team-design` | Audits and redesigns existing code |
| "Optimize React perf" | [react-development](react-development.md) | React 19 performance |

## Agents

### `frontend-design`

Web-specific frontend expert: CSS architecture, animations, design systems, UX psychology, accessibility, and visual polish.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `opus` |
| **Use for** | CSS refactoring, SASS migration, modern CSS adoption, micro-interactions, motion narrative, page transitions, design tokens, color systems, typography, UX psychology, accessibility, visual polish |

**Invocation:**
```
Use the frontend-design agent to [improve/review/implement] [component/page/design system]
```
